ABOUT THIS PROJECT:
## Why I made it?
For individual hackers, using Nuclei often involves multiple commands, which places a heavy burden on both human memory and system resources.
So I created this project to let hackers use Nuclei easily on Windows with less hassle, allowing them to focus on hacking itself.
## How to use this project?
From source code: Run pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole gui_nuclei_tool.py to package it into an executable (.exe) file for use.
Direct use: Simply use the pre-made exe file I provided.
## Note
This project is just a prototype for easy Nuclei usage. We welcome anyone to contribute to making it a much more convenient and user-friendly version.
